# The purpose of this up-counter and multi-digit display lab is to get accustomed to Verilog coding and how to display multiple digits on the seven segment display utilizing state machines in the Vivado environment. Another purpose is to provide more modular programming practice through instantiation and utilization of many components/modules from previous labs. Then design a test bench utilizing the techniques learned in class for efficiency and better practice, and learn how to display the different modules wires from the top level unexpanded view in the waveform.


# The constraints were mapped where the input clock was provided by the board, and the output mapped to the seven segment display.
